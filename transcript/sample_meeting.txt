Meeting: Weekly Team Standup
Date: 2025-05-28
Time: 10:00 AM

John: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our weekly standup. Sarah, can you give us an update on the client project?

Sarah: Sure! I've completed the initial wireframes for the dashboard. The client feedback was positive, but they want us to add a new analytics section. I'll need to coordinate with Mike on the backend API for that.

Mike: I can have the analytics API ready by Friday. Sarah, let's sync up tomorrow to go over the data structure.

John: Great. What about the mobile app, Alex?

Alex: The iOS version is almost done. Just fixing some UI bugs. Android version should be ready for testing next week. I'll need someone to help with QA testing.

Sarah: I can help with QA testing on Thursday and Friday.

John: Perfect. Any blockers or concerns?

Mike: The database migration is taking longer than expected. Might need to push the deployment to next Monday instead of Friday.

John: Okay, let's plan for Monday deployment then. Action items: Sarah will coordinate with Mike on analytics API, Alex will finish mobile app bugs, and Sarah will help with QA testing. Mike, keep us posted on the database migration progress.

Sarah: Sounds good. Should we schedule a deployment review meeting for Monday morning?

John: Yes, let's do 9 AM Monday. I'll send out the calendar invite.

Meeting ended at 10:25 AM.
